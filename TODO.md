## TODO

- Instructional text appears to have bad constraints; doesn't show up in the centre when running the game.
- Test on other devices - so far only tried on iPhone 11.
- Add unit tests
- Add UI tests

And per the tutorial, challenges:

- Give users 2 minutes, or 120 seconds, of game time. (Change a conditional somewhere, too.)
- Adjust the scoring mechanism: the time decreases twice as fast when your score is above 10. (Is that even possible?)
- Show a thumbs up or down graphic when a user inputs a number, to show whether they got it right or not
- Incorporate something like GameKit into the app, for score leaderboards.
